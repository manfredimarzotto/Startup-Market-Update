# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**Startup Intelligence Radar** — An AI-powered opportunity radar that aggregates market signals (funding rounds, hiring waves, partnerships, product launches) from RSS feeds and web sources, scores and ranks opportunities using Claude Haiku, and renders a static HTML dashboard deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Architecture

```
RSS/Scrape Sources → Ingest & Filter → Scrape Full Text → Claude Haiku Extraction → Entity Resolution → Score & Rank → JSON → build.py (Jinja2) → GitHub Pages
```

## Data Model

Six JSON files in `data/`:

- **signal_sources.json** — RSS feeds and scrape targets (id, url, type, refresh interval)
- **signals.json** — Individual market signals with type, tier, confidence, linked entities
- **companies.json** — Company profiles (sector, sub-sector, stage, HQ, employee count)
- **investors.json** — Investor profiles (type, AUM, focus sectors/geographies)
- **people.json** — Key contacts (name, role, company/investor link, LinkedIn)
- **opportunities.json** — AI-scored opportunities linking signals to entities with rationale

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) for signal extraction and scoring
- **Templating:** Jinja2
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS, CSS (clean light theme with IBM Plex Sans + JetBrains Mono)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages (deployed to `gh-pages` branch from `docs/`)

## Environment Variables

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Required for Claude Haiku signal extraction and rationale generation

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the full pipeline (ingest → scrape → extract → score → build)
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
python run.py

# Build dashboard only (renders templates with current JSON data)
python build.py

# Output appears in docs/index.html
```

## Git Workflow

- Always rebase feature branches onto `main` before merging to keep a linear history
- Use `git rebase origin/main` (not merge commits) to resolve conflicts
- **Before opening a PR**, always run `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main` to avoid conflicts
- **After a PR is squash-merged into main**, any other branch that contains the original (pre-squash) commits will conflict because git sees the squash-merge as a different commit. Fix by rebasing — git will auto-skip the already-applied commits
- **Automated pipeline commits** (`Update signals and dashboard - ...`) run daily on `main` via GitHub Actions. Long-lived feature branches will drift behind these commits. Rebase onto main before pushing to keep the branch current
- Never commit to `main` directly — always use feature branches and PRs

## Development Notes

- `run.py` orchestrates the full pipeline: ingest → scrape → extract → resolve → score → build
- `build.py` renders Jinja2 templates with JSON data into `docs/`
- All data lives in `data/*.json` — no database required
- Client-side JS handles filtering, sorting, and localStorage-based status tracking
- Generate button opens GitHub Actions dispatch page (no token exposure)
- Pipeline runs daily at 06:00 UTC via cron, plus on-demand via workflow_dispatch
- Signal types: `funding_round`, `hiring_wave`, `acquisition`, `partnership`, `product_launch`, `expansion`, `new_fund`, `media_mention`
- Signal tiers: `tier_1_strong`, `tier_2_medium`, `tier_3_weak`
- Opportunity statuses: `new`, `viewed`, `contacted`, `archived` (persisted in browser localStorage)
- RSS feeds configured in `data/signal_sources.json`
- Keyword filtering on titles/summaries minimizes unnecessary scraping and API calls
- Article text truncated to 5000 chars to keep Haiku costs low (~$0.07/day)
- Entity resolution uses fuzzy name matching; new entities auto-created when unmatched
